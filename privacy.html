                When you visit the FlexWork Cognitive, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including
                information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the installed cookies on your

                the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.” Moreover, we
                might collect the personal data you provide to us (including but not limited to Name, Surname, Address,

                Our top priority is customer data security, and, as such, we may process only minimal user data, only
                as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the website. Information collected automatically is
                used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding website
                usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that it would identify
                any particular user of the system.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
                You can visit the website without telling us who you are or revealing any information, by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the website’s features, or you wish to receive our newsletter or provide other details by filling a form, you may provide personal data to us, such as your email, first name, last name, city of residence, organization, telephone number. You can choose not to provide us with your personal data, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the website’s features. For example, you won’t be able to receive our Newsletter or contact us directly from the website. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us via contact@flexworkcognitive.in.
